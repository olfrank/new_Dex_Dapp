                            <h2>What is a Decentralized Exchange?</h2>
                            <p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a direct peer-to-peer marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies. 
                               Since its inception, DEXs have become the preferred method of exchanging crypto assets due to its minimal custodial 
                               risk, trustless transactions, low fees, and privacy features. Centralized exchanges are overseen and recorded by a 
                               central authority who gatekeeps your activity and has control/access to your account, assets and other personal 
                               information.
                               <br>
                               DEX platforms, however, are non-custodial, meaning the user retains full control over their own funds, private keys, 
                               and data. This is achieved through the use of smart contracts which self-execute under pre-determined conditions and 
                               append each transaction to the blockchain (an immutable, open source distributed ledger).

                            <h2>Limit & Market Orders</h2>
                            <p>A limit order is a type of order whereby the buyer/seller can specify the entry/exit price they wish to trade at. 
                                An individual would prefer to create a limit order if he/she believes the price of an asset is going to reach a 
                                more favorable one in the near future. However, there is no guarantee that the order will be filled within the 
                                time in which the order is left open.
                                <br><br>
                                A market order is a more straightforward approach to trading, in that, it’s an order to buy or sell security 
                                immediately at the current market price. The appeal to use one type of order over another will be situation 
                                specific and will depend on an individual’s knowledge of the asset and its projections.

                            <h2>MetaMask & Safety</h2>
                            <p>MetaMask is a HD cryptocurrency wallet which allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. In the 
                                form of a browser extension or mobile app, the MetaMask wallet allows its users to interact with decentralized 
                                applications (otherwise known as DApps), send and receive ERC-20 tokens (Ethereum based cryptocurrencies), 
                                store and manage account keys and broadcast transactions to the blockchain. 
                                While MetaMask is considered safe and private, there are still inherent risks involved in storing your funds online.
                                Critics have pointed out the potential risks involved in using MetaMask on certain sites where it can leak identifiable 
                                information to data collection networks and web trackers. It is therefore encouraged to store large amounts of crypto-assets on a hardware 
                                wallet (cold storage) and use MetaMask solely to interact with the blockchain.

                                <li>To note: this DApp is not production ready and therefore runs on the truffle testnet. Only testnet ETH is required to interact.</li>
