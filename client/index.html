                            <h2>What is a Decentralized Exchange?</h2>
                            <p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a direct peer-to-peer marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies. 
                               Since its inception, DEXs have become the preferred method of exchanging crypto assets due to its minimal custodial 
                               risk, trustless transactions, low fees, and privacy features. Centralized exchanges are overseen and recorded by a 
                               central authority who gatekeeps your activity and has control/access to your account, assets and other personal 
                               information.
                               <br>
                               DEX platforms, however, are non-custodial, meaning the user retains full control over their own funds, private keys, 
                               and data. This is achieved through the use of smart contracts which self-execute under pre-determined conditions and 
                               append each transaction to the blockchain (an immutable, open source distributed ledger). 
                            </p>

                            <h2>Limit & Market Orders</h2>
                            <p>A limit order is a type of order whereby the buyer/seller can specify the entry/exit price they wish to trade at. 
                                An individual would prefer to create a limit order if he/she believes the price of an asset is going to reach a 
                                more favorable one in the near future. However, there is no guarantee that the order will be filled within the 
                                time in which the order is left open.
                                <br><br>
                                A market order is a more straightforward approach to trading, in that, it’s an order to buy or sell security 
                                immediately at the current market price. The appeal to use one type of order over another will be situation 
                                specific and will depend on an individual’s knowledge of the asset and its projections.

                            <p><strong>Ganache </strong>allows you to run a personal Ethereum blockchain used to run tests, execute commands, and inspect 
                                state while controlling how the chain operates. Ganache is an extremely useful tool in helping developers 
                                debug, improve the security and test the functionality of their smart contracts. It also provides convenient 
                                tools such as a built-in block explorer.

                                <strong>MetaMask </strong>is a HD cryptocurrency wallet which allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. In the 
                                form of a browser extension or mobile app, the MetaMask wallet allows its users to interact with decentralized 
                                applications (otherwise known as DApps), send and receive ERC-20 tokens (Ethereum based cryptocurrencies), 
                                store and manage account keys and broadcast transactions to the blockchain.

                            <p>While MetaMask is considered safe and private, there are still inherent risks involved in storing your funds online.
                               Online wallets are a common target in phishing attacks, whereby an attacker will pose as a trusted 
                                entity and trick a victim into sharing their personal data. Critics have also pointed out the potential risks 
                                involved in using MetaMask on certain sites where it can leak identifiable information to data collection 
                                networks and web trackers. It is therefore encouraged to store large amounts of crypto-assets on a hardware 
                                wallet (cold storage) and use MetaMask solely to interact with the blockchain.
